While scrolling TikTok, I found a video mentioned that they can stalk someone using Artificial Intelligence (Ai) such as ChatGPT just using a simple prompt and `Target` social media. So, in this proof of concept (PoC), i explore on how publicly available information can be gathered using nothing more simple prompt and `target` social media handle.

# Prompts Example. 

```
1. "Give full details about "Target social media handler/ Full name" -> General information gather from various source from the internet

2. "Give full details about "Target social media" on "Social Media" -> Specific from which platform does the target or user handler commontly use or active the most,
resulting on the gathered information from the platform only.
```

## PoC Prompt 1

```
Based on the resulted and the sources where all the information gathered, its show that the information is actually quite legit, cause from the source itself, it lead to the same account with the correct details. From the resulted, we obtained :

-Full Name
- 
```

## PoC Prompt 2 

![poc2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb07a5f3-9e98-463e-96b1-f6b9505603a0)

```
Using the second prompt, I'm using the target public account and specified the platform (Github).

From the prompt we obtained as much as possible of the information from the target or user Github account.

We got the handler, display name, location (if included), total respo, others social media linked to the Github, the summary of the content in the public respo etc.
