## SYNOPSIS

> On March 2025, one of my contact (Victim) TikTok account was approached by someone that offered her a job to be a model for their new startup clothing brand companies that will release their first design in a few days. As student of fashion design and active tiktok user, being approached and offered to became a model of a clothing brand should be a good experience for her carreer. So she accept the offer and the conversation was continued on Telegram. Luckily the victim was busy with her training so the conversation was drag for quite sometime until she met me. In this cases, she seeked for my help to make sure the job offer is legit and not some scamming operation. So here is the step by step and method that I take to reveal the truth behind this operation (Include Plotwist). 

> Method used : Image Analyst, SOCMINT, Open Source Information Gathering, interrogation

## 1) WHAT MAKE THE  VICTIM FALL FOR THE JOB OFFERS? 

### I. THE DEDICATION OF THE APPROACHER. 
> The approacher willing to wait for the victim confirmation. The victim was busy with her volleyball training, that cause the conversation being drag for about 2 days. The approacher could just went to find other person because why not? fast respond fast money. That kind of method could lead the victim to think that "They really want me" or "I got the talent" syndrome. 

### II. THE JOB PAYMENTS 
> The jobs offers 3 workings days with the total payment : Ringgit Malaysia (RM) 1150. Intresting and good offer indeed since with that amount, it could be someone else part time monthly salary. Even more to the offer goes to a students.

### III. PRETEND TO REALLY SEND THEIR DESIGN TO THE VICTIM 
> The approacher send a few design of their first batch and ask the victim to choose 3 of them and will be send to the victim in 2 days. This action will help to gain the trust from the victim and made her believe that the company is real.

## 2) WHAT "OFF" REGARDING THE JOB OFFERS & THE COMPANY

### I. COMPANY NAMES IN THE INVOICE AND TELEGRAM HANDLE IS DIFFERENT. 
> Refer the image below, the approacher mentioned the company name was `HCBC Clothing` meanwhile in the invoice state as `HSBC Clothing`.

### II. NO SOCIAL MEDIA. 
> When asking about the company details such as social media, the approacher mentioned that, they not yet have social media and said that the social media will be created or promoted during the launching.

### III. THE "NOT MAKE SENSE" PROCEDURE. 
> The approacher said that the cloths will be send to the victim in a 2 days ahead, but she mentioned that the company also would like to do the presentation to look how the model in the cloths also in 2 days. The victim has sent the picture but the picture is not suitable for editing. So they requested video call session with the victim and the will do an edit from the video call known as "VC Editing" 

### IV. CENSORED BUSINESS REGISTRATION NUMBER. 
> The victim ask for the company registration numbers, the approacher provide the company registration cert but only leave the `2 first digit`. When ask why they covered it, the mentioned for that for security and avoid risk purposes.

## 3) DEEP ANALYSIS 

```
Due to the lack of evidence and suspicious of the company existance and job offers, we can already detected it as a scam or just "Ghost" them. But in my cases, i just want to investigate it a little bit deeper, and make sure all of them walk with the truth. 
```

### I. ANALAYZE THE COMPANY BUSINESS REGISTATRION CERTIFICATE. 
```
On the Business registration certificate, using the business registration number (SSM) we can verify the company existence and make sure the companies was legit. But in this cases, the registation numbers was censored and we cannot do some searching. But here a few mistakes from the scammer.
```

####  - UNCENSORED COMPANY FULL NAME

> Throughout the whole conversation, the approacher never mentioned the full name of the company but from the cert we can clearly see the company name which is "HCBC Clothing Enterprise". Using  [Malaysian Corporate Information Databses](https://www.mydata-ssm.com.my/homePage), we can find open information regarding the registered company with just the company name. Searching for the companies name, the databases return zero result which mean the companies with the name of "HCBC Clothing Enterprise" is not even exist or registered.

#### - OUTDATED AUTHORITY/BUSINESS REGISTRAR SIGN. 

> From the image we can see the registrar in charge to sign the cert is "Name", but the approacher mentioned the company is new and just want to launch their first product in this year which is 2025. for you information, "Registrat name" contracted was end on september 2020, 5 years ago, the current registrar in charge was "new registrat name". How was the new built company and will launch first product have a 2020 and below business registration certificate. Business certification cert expired date in 5 years and need to be renew.

#### II. STOLEN CLOTHS DESIGN POSTER. 
```
Remember the poster of the couples of design of their new launch, i do some analyze from the image and found a quite intresting found. 
```

#### - DESIGN OWNED BY OTHERS BRAND AND RELEASED 1 YEARS AGO. 

> Reverse image the poster, resulted an instagram account that post the exact same image with the exact same design from the poster that the approacher or scammers sent.


> Visit the instagaram account, we can see the aircond owned by others company known as "Company Name"

> The post was made on Mar 2024.


## 4) PLOT-TWIST 

```
Afer found the solid evidence about the fake poster and the existance of the company, we confront the approacher and response from the approacher shock me. Let discuss : 
```

#### I.  THE APPORACHER WAS ALSO APPROACH BY SOMEONE ELSE ?
