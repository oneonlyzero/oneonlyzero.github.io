### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CASE.

> In March 2025, one of my contacts (Victim) had her TikTok account approached by someone offering her a modeling job for their new startup clothing brand, which was set to release its first designs in a few days. As a fashion design student and active TikTok user, being approached and offered a modeling job should have been a great experience for her portfolio. So, she accepted the offer, and the conversation continued on Telegram. Luckily, the victim was busy with her training, so the conversation dragged on for quite some time until she met me. In this case, she sought my help to verify whether the job offer was legitimate or a scam. Below is the step-by-step method I used to reveal the truth behind this operation (including a plot twist). 

### RED FLAGS REGARDING THE JOB OFFER & COMPANY

#### I. COMPANY NAME DISCREPANCY IN THE INVOICE AND TELEGRAM HANDLE.

> Refer to the image provided: the scammer mentioned the company name as `HCBC Clothing`, while the invoice stated `HSHC Clothing`.

#### II. NO SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE. 
> When asked about the company’s details, such as social media, the scammer claimed they didn’t have any yet and that social media would be created and promoted during the launch.

#### III. ILLOGICAL PROCEDURES. 
> The scammer claimed that the clothes would be shipped to the victim in two days but also said that the company wanted to do a presentation to see how the model looked in the clothes—also within two days. The victim sent a picture, but the scammer said it wasn’t suitable for editing. They then requested a video call session with the victim, saying they would edit from the video call footage, a method they called "VC Editing."

#### IV. CENSORED BUSINESS REGISTRATION NUMBER.

> When the victim asked for the company’s registration number, the scammer provided a certificate but only revealed the first two digits. When questioned about this, they claimed it was for security and risk prevention purposes.

### DEEP ANALYSIS 
```
Due to the lack of evidence and the suspicious nature of the company and job offer, we could have already identified it as a scam or simply ghosted them. However, in my case, I wanted to investigate deeper and ensure the truth was uncovered. 
```

### I. ANALAYZE THE COMPANY BUSINESS REGISTATRION CERTIFICATE. 
```
Using the business registration number (SSM), we can verify a company’s existence and legitimacy. However, in this case, the registration number was censored, preventing us from searching for it. But here are a few mistakes the scammer made.
```

##### - UNCENSORED COMPANY FULL NAME

![Companyname](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb74840-68a9-4df5-babf-6c78b7b2df5d)

> Throughout the whole conversation, the scammer never mentioned the full company name. However, on the certificate, we could clearly see "HCBC Clothing Enterprise." Using [Malaysian Corporate Information Databases](https://www.mydata-ssm.com.my/homePage), we searched for this name. The database returned zero results, meaning no such company existed or was registered.

##### - OUTDATED AUTHORITY/BUSINESS REGISTRAR SIGNATURE. 

![Oldregistrarname](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d2463fd-03bc-4913-991d-ba472f9ad929)

> The certificate showed that the registrar in charge was "Dato Zahrah Abd Wahab Fenner," but the scammer claimed the company was new and about to launch its first product in 2025.

> However, an article post published on 2019 mentioned that "Dato Zahrah Abd Wahab Fenner’s" contract ended in September 2020—five years ago

>  The current registrar is "name" How could a newly formed company launching its first product have a certificate signed by a registrar from five years ago? Business registration certificates expire in five years and need renewal.

### II. STOLEN CLOTHS DESIGN POSTER. 
```
Remember the poster with the designs for the supposed launch? I analyzed the image and obtain intersiting finding :.
```

##### - DESIGN OWNED BY ANOTHER BRAND AND RELEASED A YEAR AGO. 

> A reverse image search led to an Instagram account that had posted the exact same image and designs sent by the scammer.

> Visiting the Instagram account, we found that the clothing brand belonged to another company, "[Company Name]."

> The post was made in March 2024.

### III. COMPANIES LOGO.
```
The company logo in the scammer’s profile picture was blurry, so I performed a reverse image search.
```
##### - LOGO OWNED BY SOMEONE ELSE. 
> I found a Reddit post featuring the exact same logo. The original designer stated it was a beta version of

![Logofound](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7028574-4b59-4a31-b9ff-ac359b535695)

> a logo representing "Harlem Boss," posted three years ago.

## LESSON LEARN

```
1. Do not fall for job offers promising easy money, especially during festive seasons or emergencies. There is no such thing as easy money; you have to work for it.
2. Always research the company and job offer before accepting anything.
