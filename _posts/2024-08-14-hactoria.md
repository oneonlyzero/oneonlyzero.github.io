Greetings Special Agent.

After starting our collaboration with Klumgongyn and his species, a lot of the earth’s mysteries have started to clear up. Not being able to share these with the rest of the world but, suffice to say, a lot of sci-fi movies aren’t that far off from reality.

One of such interesting topics is the existence of Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as it the more formal term. These creatures roam the interiors of the American heartland and reach far up north. For several decades, people have had run-ins and sightings with these creatures.

Originally, Sasquatches evolved next to their human counterparts. But after eventually growing apart, due to our new found aversion to the discomfort of sleeping on the forest floor, they’ve taken refuge in the most rugged parts of the American wilderness. While we eventually opted for sleeping in home-delivered Swedish furniture.

As Klumgongyn now taught us, the Klumgon have been using Sasquatches to keep an eye on human behavior over the past decades. Instructing the beasts to probe human civilization for our reaction to a strange and foreign species. Needless to say, the results are still very negative. The best theory would have humans shoot the alien being and cut it’s guts open. Therefor only a select group of humans know about the existence of the Klumgon and Sasquatch.

Now that we got that introduction out of the way… During the 1970’s, a Sasquatch was spotted by a member of the US Armed forces. Initially reported as “Driver has close sighting of Bigfoot”. While heading home from a late night diner, the soldier spotted the Sasquatch crossing the road late at night. After this sighting, the Sasquatch was never seen again. Even disappearing to it’s Klumgon handlers.

This particular Sasquatch was named “Norman” by it’s handlers. What made Norman special, was the ability to turn his nocturnal vision on and off. A genetic abnormality for the otherwise nocturnal Sasquatch. The Klumgon needed Norman to reverse engineer this ability, to implement in a piece of biotech for their “Future Soldier of 2030” government program.

Needless to say, given our current collaboration, that would be a very useful piece of bio-tech. Not having to rely on clunky and limited NVG’s, but a simple set of new eyes and a microchip instead.

So, I leave you with your assignment. Find the article where this particular soldier describes the incident. This will be the starting point for our investigation. All we know, is that the article is published by someone else, chronicling the story shared by the soldier.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

Greetings, Special Agent K.

Our friends over at the South Africa National Defense Force have reached out for help. Recently, one of their patrols in the north of their country, came under fire from an armored vehicle. At first they thought this to be friendly fire, however no other units were in the area.

They sent a drone to inspect the vehicle and managed to take a photo, before being forced to retreat. Six out of the twenty-four strong platoon were injured, all survived after being evacuated by helicopter.

As they are unfamiliar with the model of the tank, which has since vanished. Therefor they call for our help in identifying the vehicle. That is where you come in, identify the tank so we can track the origins and maybe get further in this investigation.

Greetings, Special Agent.

We have an urgent and very grim scenario on our hands. About 20 minutes ago, we received word from one of our red teams, that they’ve uncovered plans on the dark-web to test a new neuro-toxic gas on an undisclosed city.

The group’s name has not yet been uncovered, but is believed to operate decentralized online, sharing the same ideal in the radical right spheres. Over the past months, we’ve observed talks and discussions, glorification of and finally concrete plans to build a dirty bomb.

As of today, our HUMINT team was able to infiltrate partial circles of the group. Our Red Team was able to pull images from the browser cache of the member our HUMINT team was in contact with.

The image reveals a city, which is believed to be the testing ground for the dirty bomb. We still do not have a time-frame for the attack, all we know is that the amount of gas will cost hundreds of people their lives. Not to mention the suffering ending caused by the gas itself.

Our priorities are to find out more about the group, this is done in collaboration with EUROPOL, hence our main task is finding the location of the city. We hope the realization that the location of their plans has leaked, will cause some of the members to make a bad move.

Your task is to locate the city in the image below.

We have a special case on our hands today. As tensions around the island nation of Taiwan rise by the day, allied nations reach out frequently for our help. Today is no exception.

This morning at 09:43 Taipei Standard Time, the Taiwanese Navy identified a foreign vessel entering it’s waters. Upon making contact, the ship left westward for international waters. However, a UAV was dispatched and managed to snatch a picture of the vessel.

The ship did not identify, nor does it match the database of known vessels operated by any Navy around the world. It comes close to several, but appears to be altered for a different purpose.

The Taiwanese government signed a contract for our services to identify the original make and model of the vessel.

Greetings Special Agent.

We have a request on our hands from our friends over at the CIA. In September of 2021, one of their operatives went missing in action. Upon further investigation, it was discovered this operative went rogue and started a smuggling business for the Russians. Mostly dealing in complex electronics, which have become difficult to come by for Russians after sanctions began.

The agent we’re looking for is named Valentino Maggi. Born in Brooklyn New York on 18.05.1987. Valentino is one of five sons of the Valentino family, who moved to the United States during World War II. Having grown up a middle class lifestyle, his father a car salesman and mother working as an elementary school teacher. Valentino was recruited into the CIA during his time as a student at Columbia University.

Most of his 10 years in active service were spent as an analyst working out of Langley. Recently though, in August of 2020, Valentino moved to oversees work. Being stationed in Italy as a liaison officer for the Italian foreign intelligence agency “Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna”.

Doing stellar work, right up until the point he went missing. Prompting an extensive investigation into his whereabouts. Documents were eventually found on his computer, recovered using forensics tools to recover deleted files. These indicate a heavy involvement with the Russian underground. Acquiring much needed microelectronics for the Russian government.

And that is where your task begins, Special Agent K. One of the files recovered from Valentino’s computer, is an image with a text file. We believe this to be the current location of Valentino Maggi. Locate the safehouse, so local authorities can raid the premises.

Greetings, Special Agent.

We have received information regarding the long lost spy from MI5, Deloris Frozenwood. She went missing in action a few years ago, never to be seen again. From what we understand, she went on to provide services to whoever the highest bidder might be.

Before she went rogue, Deloris was a revered operative within MI5. Taking on some of the most dangerous assignments and quickly working her way through the ranks. Discontent with management, she took matters into her own hands. Often skirting the lines between rule of law and criminal behavior. She was eventually terminated from MI5.

What happened after her career at MI5 remains shrouded in mystery. She showed up on the radar several times, but only for very brief moments. Having become a target of the organization she once worked for, she’s even gotten arrogant. Often making deliberate appearances for a brief moment, before vanishing to the shadows once again.

Our colleagues at MI5 have asked us to obtain any information on Deloris Frozenwood we can find. They’re particularly interested in social media profiles. For reference, Deloris often appears as “Deloris Frozenwood”, or as “D Frozenwood”.

If you find Deloris, her presence will lead you to the password to unlock your ZIP file, containing the badge for this contract.

### Mission 

```
Sanaya Patel, an agent for the S.I.S.U. had been working tirelessly and finally decided to take a much-needed vacation. She decided she would spend it in a small town in Michigan, hoping to relax and unwind.

One evening, while exploring the town, she met a man named Thomas Griswold. They hit it off immediately and spent the next few days together, enjoying each other’s company, having a great time. Sanaya felt like she had finally found someone who understood her.

However, things suddenly took a turn for the worse when Thomas started acting strange. He was agitated and on edge. Sanaya could tell that something was bothering him and when she asked if everything was ok he lashed out in a fit of rage, almost hitting her. But he stopped himself and stormed out of the room.

Sanaya was left alone and confused, in a state of shock wondering what had happened. Moments later her confusion soon turned to horror when she heard a commotion outside. She rushed out to find Thomas lying on the ground, with someone rummaging through his pockets. The stranger fled the scene when he saw Sanaya running towards him screaming out.

The Michigan Police Department was called and they began investigating the incident. They questioned Sanaya and with the help of a sketch artist they were able to quickly identify the stranger as Jonathan Bedwell. Jonathan is an accountant in the next county, with no criminal record or history of violence. The whole situation was puzzling, and Sanaya couldn’t understand why someone would kill Thomas.

Sanaya handed the Chief her card and then went and sat in the break room. The Chief contacted the SISU Deputy Director and was inform that Sanaya was a Special Agent. The Chief walked into the break room, “Your Director speaks very highly of you, says you are one of the best. He also said to let you know that Thomas Griswold was a recent ex-member of the criminal organization by the name of ‘Criminopeia’ and that all the resources of the SISU were at your disposal.

It didn’t take long for Jonathan to be apprehended, and in questioning he said that he ran because he was scared. He was looking for a USB that Thomas had told him he had. “Thomas called me yesterday saying that he had information about my daughter but that I was not to contact the police or she would never be found alive. The instructions were to meet him outside the shop and that he would bring me a USB that would provide information about the location of my daughter. “My Juanita has been missing for 4 weeks and you have done nothing to find her. Telling me she probably just ran away.” Thomas said after I had the USB I was to walk into the shop and give it to someone named Sanaya. He said she would know what to do. Everyone turned and looked at Sanaya. She put out her hand to receive the USB, “I am Sanaya.”

Sanaya may still be in shock and we need to help. The image below was all the data contained on the data the USB. Help us find the little girl and bring her back to her father.

## GEO-OSINT : Wheres Klumgongyn - Easy. 

![Badge_Wheres_Klumgongyn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ff4d1c-f2d1-4c74-aabf-206ce7da307d)

### Mission 

```
Greetings Special Agent.

We have quite a strange case on our hands today. Our Lead Counsel Klumgongyn, has gone missing in action.

Now don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean this in any dangerous way. Lately the company chat has been used as a dumpster for GIF wars and edgy memes. Klumgongyn was so fed up with this, that he took one of the spaceships and warped to an unknown location.

He says it’s a “surprise vacation” and won’t come back for another two weeks. This is of course unacceptable behavior and we need to find him.

After arrival he sent a picture with the message “see you in two weeks memelords”. We need you to geolocate the image so we can send in a retrieval unit to pick him up.

Whether we’ll actually find him once we’re there is another issue. Shapeshifting alien lizard like creatures are hard to spot. They’ve been posing as politicians for years now and nobody’s really caught on to them either.

Special Agent K, you have 24 hours to locate Klumgongyn. After that we’ll start refusing to reimburse his travel expenses.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept

Greetings, Special Agent K

We have received a distress call from Thalia one of our Analysts, who has been the victim of a criminal syndicate known as “The High Guard.” Thalia was given a note by the kidnappers, but it is encoded with a complex algorithm that we have been unable to crack. We need your help in decoding the contents of this note in order to gain valuable information about the whereabouts of Thalia’s lover and the inner workings of The High Guard. Your expertise in cryptography and code-breaking is essential to this mission. We believe that the encoded note contains key details about the location of the kidnappers and the safe return of Thalia’s lover.

### Answer Instruction. 

```
Answer format: Streetname-City

Answer sample: Rue-de-Linda-Salvador
```

### Solution 


> 1) First we need to decode the the messages, i use dcode cipher identifier to identify the cipher type of the encyrpted text, as we can see here it is a Rot8000 Cipher, so we can use that to decode it. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc96e2e4-c25f-4a18-9eeb-fe358c84e860)


>  2) In the decoded message, its lead us to a telegram bot called "TheHighGuard_Bot", to chat with this bot simply go your telegram and find the bot name. You will find a telegram bot account with Quantum name.

>  3) use /start fucntion chat with tbe bot, the bot will give 2 more function to us which is /secret and /location. based on the the message that we decode, it wanted us to use the "For Your Eyes Only" as our secret, so use the /secret function it will prompt us to give the secret strings. Insert the secret and we will get an image from the bot (Material 2).


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6bc7839-bd57-409b-9190-f38f0ba3c68a)

>  4) We need to find the location of the image and use the name of the location to the /location function to the next step, from the instruction under the image, it mentions the location is between laon,France and Reims,France.

> 5) I try to reverse the image to get some familliar image or clue to make search scope smaller, in the image we can see a lot of wood pallet and a few others equipments and warehouse belongs to an wood industrial or sawmill, try to find sawmill near the two location which laon and reims, found several mill but none of them lead me to the location.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5cd06e-9707-49dc-a8e9-cb25da892093)


>  6) Need a little bit help from others writeup, and yah i was close, just need to think outside of the box which is, what if the location is a sawmill but it spells in france language, so the word "Scierie" is sawmill in france, using google maps use dork "Scierie near laon and reims, got a few more sawmill, but we gonna focuse on three sawmill since the messages say it between laon and reims.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcea8f64-326d-44bd-a8cf-d2114a0ff575)


>  7) After a few minute take around those three sawmill, we found the exact location which is Scierie Huberlant, use the location name in the bot /location function, it will give us another information.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d43b63-03e5-45b5-817e-5a9d5e293f45)


>  8) The information that we got is basically related to the mobile network's cell tower location which is MCC (Mobile Country Code): 208, MNC (Mobile Network Code): 10, AC (Location Area Code): 12102, CID (Cell ID): 9448453.

> 9) To find the location based on the information that we got, we can use tool called opencellid.org, fill in the search function with the information that we got, and it will lead to the location where the cell tower located.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01c74e5-87b0-40c6-9a8d-421f62424483)


>  10) There are to many cell towers in the map, how do you know which one is the one that we have to find, simply click the to the symbol and you can see the information of the cell tower, then we will find the exact tower with the same information that we got located at the Rue de Picardie street in Paris, that sound like our password. use it to unlock flag file and yup we got it.

![badge Kanonniers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60bc8232-1261-4a37-a0b8-1f1e98bf403d)

### Mission 

```
Greetings, Special Agent.

We are on the hunt for operatives of a competing Order. We believe them to be the continuation of a rival Order “The Golden Creed”, who we eradicated mid 18th century. Somehow the family running the Order managed to reorganize and fund new endeavors. Flying under the radar for several years, they now have a foothold in many European countries.

Unfortunately for them, they’ve chosen to cross paths with some of our bigger clients in several of these countries. Most recently, the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD, started investigating them after being linked to a human trafficking ring. All beginning with the Syrian refugee crisis a few years back.

What made this Order fly under the radar for many years, is their total aversion for the digital world. Barely dipping their toes in web 1.0, The Golden Creed uses mostly analog means of communication. Making them infinitely harder to track.

Our friends at the AIVD however once observed a member of The Golden Creed insert a package into an opening of a monument. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be instructions for a hit being placed by a client of The Golden Creed.

This leads us to your objective. Last week, an operative of The Golden Creed was arrested by Dutch police. Carrying a picture with him of an old cannon. Given their tendency to hide information in historical objects, we believe this particular cannon is a location of interest. Possibly holding information, or being frequently used to pass information.

Our client has asked us to locate the cannon. Use the image below to find the location of the cannon.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept

### Material 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdbc47b9-4091-46a3-aa60-69bac230db12)

### Answer Instruction 

```
Use your findings to generate the answer. For this you will need the service: [w3w](https://what3words.com/)

Format:
areacode-city-what-three-words

Example:
5555-nice-belt-hamburger-phone
```

### Solution 

> 1) Reverse search the material and the result will show the location where cannon located which is `Elburg stadswandeling` located in the city of `Elburg`.
> 2) Next, we need to find where exact location of the cannon in the big area, here i use th website that show the photogenic spot in the place.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075e69ef-a684-4111-8420-de16922579d6)

> 3) As you can see the kannon located at the bottom of the area, let take a little more close up look using google maps on that area.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848d4e09-42b9-4036-ac1a-fbe151459d51)

> 4) There are 2 cannon in that area, but with the angle of the image in the material, we know the one that we talking about is the one at the left.
> 5) Using the W3W website to get the three words, we get these 3 words : `punk.runways.messed`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f51560-304c-4c63-9bfd-5308745121e6)

> 6) To find the area code, just google for `Elburg` area code and you will get the area code : `0525`. Combine it as our answer and we solved it.
