Greetings Special Agent.

After starting our collaboration with Klumgongyn and his species, a lot of the earth’s mysteries have started to clear up. Not being able to share these with the rest of the world but, suffice to say, a lot of sci-fi movies aren’t that far off from reality.

One of such interesting topics is the existence of Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as it the more formal term. These creatures roam the interiors of the American heartland and reach far up north. For several decades, people have had run-ins and sightings with these creatures.

Originally, Sasquatches evolved next to their human counterparts. But after eventually growing apart, due to our new found aversion to the discomfort of sleeping on the forest floor, they’ve taken refuge in the most rugged parts of the American wilderness. While we eventually opted for sleeping in home-delivered Swedish furniture.

As Klumgongyn now taught us, the Klumgon have been using Sasquatches to keep an eye on human behavior over the past decades. Instructing the beasts to probe human civilization for our reaction to a strange and foreign species. Needless to say, the results are still very negative. The best theory would have humans shoot the alien being and cut it’s guts open. Therefor only a select group of humans know about the existence of the Klumgon and Sasquatch.

Now that we got that introduction out of the way… During the 1970’s, a Sasquatch was spotted by a member of the US Armed forces. Initially reported as “Driver has close sighting of Bigfoot”. While heading home from a late night diner, the soldier spotted the Sasquatch crossing the road late at night. After this sighting, the Sasquatch was never seen again. Even disappearing to it’s Klumgon handlers.

This particular Sasquatch was named “Norman” by it’s handlers. What made Norman special, was the ability to turn his nocturnal vision on and off. A genetic abnormality for the otherwise nocturnal Sasquatch. The Klumgon needed Norman to reverse engineer this ability, to implement in a piece of biotech for their “Future Soldier of 2030” government program.

Needless to say, given our current collaboration, that would be a very useful piece of bio-tech. Not having to rely on clunky and limited NVG’s, but a simple set of new eyes and a microchip instead.

So, I leave you with your assignment. Find the article where this particular soldier describes the incident. This will be the starting point for our investigation. All we know, is that the article is published by someone else, chronicling the story shared by the soldier.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

Greetings, Special Agent K.

Our friends over at the South Africa National Defense Force have reached out for help. Recently, one of their patrols in the north of their country, came under fire from an armored vehicle. At first they thought this to be friendly fire, however no other units were in the area.

They sent a drone to inspect the vehicle and managed to take a photo, before being forced to retreat. Six out of the twenty-four strong platoon were injured, all survived after being evacuated by helicopter.

As they are unfamiliar with the model of the tank, which has since vanished. Therefor they call for our help in identifying the vehicle. That is where you come in, identify the tank so we can track the origins and maybe get further in this investigation.

Greetings, Special Agent.

We have an urgent and very grim scenario on our hands. About 20 minutes ago, we received word from one of our red teams, that they’ve uncovered plans on the dark-web to test a new neuro-toxic gas on an undisclosed city.

The group’s name has not yet been uncovered, but is believed to operate decentralized online, sharing the same ideal in the radical right spheres. Over the past months, we’ve observed talks and discussions, glorification of and finally concrete plans to build a dirty bomb.

As of today, our HUMINT team was able to infiltrate partial circles of the group. Our Red Team was able to pull images from the browser cache of the member our HUMINT team was in contact with.

The image reveals a city, which is believed to be the testing ground for the dirty bomb. We still do not have a time-frame for the attack, all we know is that the amount of gas will cost hundreds of people their lives. Not to mention the suffering ending caused by the gas itself.

Our priorities are to find out more about the group, this is done in collaboration with EUROPOL, hence our main task is finding the location of the city. We hope the realization that the location of their plans has leaked, will cause some of the members to make a bad move.

Your task is to locate the city in the image below.

Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have a special case on our hands today. As tensions around the island nation of Taiwan rise by the day, allied nations reach out frequently for our help. Today is no exception.

This morning at 09:43 Taipei Standard Time, the Taiwanese Navy identified a foreign vessel entering it’s waters. Upon making contact, the ship left westward for international waters. However, a UAV was dispatched and managed to snatch a picture of the vessel.

The ship did not identify, nor does it match the database of known vessels operated by any Navy around the world. It comes close to several, but appears to be altered for a different purpose.

The Taiwanese government signed a contract for our services to identify the original make and model of the vessel.

Greetings Special Agent.

We have a request on our hands from our friends over at the CIA. In September of 2021, one of their operatives went missing in action. Upon further investigation, it was discovered this operative went rogue and started a smuggling business for the Russians. Mostly dealing in complex electronics, which have become difficult to come by for Russians after sanctions began.

The agent we’re looking for is named Valentino Maggi. Born in Brooklyn New York on 18.05.1987. Valentino is one of five sons of the Valentino family, who moved to the United States during World War II. Having grown up a middle class lifestyle, his father a car salesman and mother working as an elementary school teacher. Valentino was recruited into the CIA during his time as a student at Columbia University.

Most of his 10 years in active service were spent as an analyst working out of Langley. Recently though, in August of 2020, Valentino moved to oversees work. Being stationed in Italy as a liaison officer for the Italian foreign intelligence agency “Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna”.

Doing stellar work, right up until the point he went missing. Prompting an extensive investigation into his whereabouts. Documents were eventually found on his computer, recovered using forensics tools to recover deleted files. These indicate a heavy involvement with the Russian underground. Acquiring much needed microelectronics for the Russian government.

And that is where your task begins, Special Agent K. One of the files recovered from Valentino’s computer, is an image with a text file. We believe this to be the current location of Valentino Maggi. Locate the safehouse, so local authorities can raid the premises.

Greetings, Special Agent.

We have received information regarding the long lost spy from MI5, Deloris Frozenwood. She went missing in action a few years ago, never to be seen again. From what we understand, she went on to provide services to whoever the highest bidder might be.

Before she went rogue, Deloris was a revered operative within MI5. Taking on some of the most dangerous assignments and quickly working her way through the ranks. Discontent with management, she took matters into her own hands. Often skirting the lines between rule of law and criminal behavior. She was eventually terminated from MI5.

What happened after her career at MI5 remains shrouded in mystery. She showed up on the radar several times, but only for very brief moments. Having become a target of the organization she once worked for, she’s even gotten arrogant. Often making deliberate appearances for a brief moment, before vanishing to the shadows once again.

Our colleagues at MI5 have asked us to obtain any information on Deloris Frozenwood we can find. They’re particularly interested in social media profiles. For reference, Deloris often appears as “Deloris Frozenwood”, or as “D Frozenwood”.

If you find Deloris, her presence will lead you to the password to unlock your ZIP file, containing the badge for this contract.

### Mission 

```
Sanaya Patel, an agent for the S.I.S.U. had been working tirelessly and finally decided to take a much-needed vacation. She decided she would spend it in a small town in Michigan, hoping to relax and unwind.

One evening, while exploring the town, she met a man named Thomas Griswold. They hit it off immediately and spent the next few days together, enjoying each other’s company, having a great time. Sanaya felt like she had finally found someone who understood her.

However, things suddenly took a turn for the worse when Thomas started acting strange. He was agitated and on edge. Sanaya could tell that something was bothering him and when she asked if everything was ok he lashed out in a fit of rage, almost hitting her. But he stopped himself and stormed out of the room.

Sanaya was left alone and confused, in a state of shock wondering what had happened. Moments later her confusion soon turned to horror when she heard a commotion outside. She rushed out to find Thomas lying on the ground, with someone rummaging through his pockets. The stranger fled the scene when he saw Sanaya running towards him screaming out.

The Michigan Police Department was called and they began investigating the incident. They questioned Sanaya and with the help of a sketch artist they were able to quickly identify the stranger as Jonathan Bedwell. Jonathan is an accountant in the next county, with no criminal record or history of violence. The whole situation was puzzling, and Sanaya couldn’t understand why someone would kill Thomas.

Sanaya handed the Chief her card and then went and sat in the break room. The Chief contacted the SISU Deputy Director and was inform that Sanaya was a Special Agent. The Chief walked into the break room, “Your Director speaks very highly of you, says you are one of the best. He also said to let you know that Thomas Griswold was a recent ex-member of the criminal organization by the name of ‘Criminopeia’ and that all the resources of the SISU were at your disposal.

It didn’t take long for Jonathan to be apprehended, and in questioning he said that he ran because he was scared. He was looking for a USB that Thomas had told him he had. “Thomas called me yesterday saying that he had information about my daughter but that I was not to contact the police or she would never be found alive. The instructions were to meet him outside the shop and that he would bring me a USB that would provide information about the location of my daughter. “My Juanita has been missing for 4 weeks and you have done nothing to find her. Telling me she probably just ran away.” Thomas said after I had the USB I was to walk into the shop and give it to someone named Sanaya. He said she would know what to do. Everyone turned and looked at Sanaya. She put out her hand to receive the USB, “I am Sanaya.”

Sanaya may still be in shock and we need to help. The image below was all the data contained on the data the USB. Help us find the little girl and bring her back to her father.

## GEO-OSINT : Wheres Klumgongyn - Easy. 

![Badge_Wheres_Klumgongyn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ff4d1c-f2d1-4c74-aabf-206ce7da307d)

### Mission 

```
Greetings Special Agent.

We have quite a strange case on our hands today. Our Lead Counsel Klumgongyn, has gone missing in action.

Now don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean this in any dangerous way. Lately the company chat has been used as a dumpster for GIF wars and edgy memes. Klumgongyn was so fed up with this, that he took one of the spaceships and warped to an unknown location.

He says it’s a “surprise vacation” and won’t come back for another two weeks. This is of course unacceptable behavior and we need to find him.

After arrival he sent a picture with the message “see you in two weeks memelords”. We need you to geolocate the image so we can send in a retrieval unit to pick him up.

Whether we’ll actually find him once we’re there is another issue. Shapeshifting alien lizard like creatures are hard to spot. They’ve been posing as politicians for years now and nobody’s really caught on to them either.

Special Agent K, you have 24 hours to locate Klumgongyn. After that we’ll start refusing to reimburse his travel expenses.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept

Use the Country and Streetname to form the answer.

Example: turkey-street-name
```

### Solution

>  1) In the material provided, the image quality is not so good so it hard to actually reverse it, we have to put a little effort here. Firstly, we took the info that we can get from the picture, which is in the image we can the `My taxi` and the number `2122` (got confuse on the first 3 digits either 588 or what). 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d8ce23-ffe4-41ea-999b-91ac78d9871d)


>  2) With that info, do a little bit searching on google, and we got a facebook profile that related to it, in the about section of the profile, we got more info which it is a taxi service In S.Hithadhoo, Addu City in maldives.

Greetings, Special Agent K

We have received a distress call from Thalia one of our Analysts, who has been the victim of a criminal syndicate known as “The High Guard.” Thalia was given a note by the kidnappers, but it is encoded with a complex algorithm that we have been unable to crack. We need your help in decoding the contents of this note in order to gain valuable information about the whereabouts of Thalia’s lover and the inner workings of The High Guard. Your expertise in cryptography and code-breaking is essential to this mission. We believe that the encoded note contains key details about the location of the kidnappers and the safe return of Thalia’s lover.

### Answer Instruction. 

```
Answer format: Streetname-City

Answer sample: Rue-de-Linda-Salvador
```

### Solution 


> 1) First we need to decode the the messages, i use dcode cipher identifier to identify the cipher type of the encyrpted text, as we can see here it is a Rot8000 Cipher, so we can use that to decode it. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc96e2e4-c25f-4a18-9eeb-fe358c84e860)


>  2) In the decoded message, its lead us to a telegram bot called "TheHighGuard_Bot", to chat with this bot simply go your telegram and find the bot name. You will find a telegram bot account with Quantum name.

>  3) use /start fucntion chat with tbe bot, the bot will give 2 more function to us which is /secret and /location. based on the the message that we decode, it wanted us to use the "For Your Eyes Only" as our secret, so use the /secret function it will prompt us to give the secret strings. Insert the secret and we will get an image from the bot (Material 2).


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6bc7839-bd57-409b-9190-f38f0ba3c68a)

>  4) We need to find the location of the image and use the name of the location to the /location function to the next step, from the instruction under the image, it mentions the location is between laon,France and Reims,France.

> 5) I try to reverse the image to get some familliar image or clue to make search scope smaller, in the image we can see a lot of wood pallet and a few others equipments and warehouse belongs to an wood industrial or sawmill, try to find sawmill near the two location which laon and reims, found several mill but none of them lead me to the location.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5cd06e-9707-49dc-a8e9-cb25da892093)


>  6) Need a little bit help from others writeup, and yah i was close, just need to think outside of the box which is, what if the location is a sawmill but it spells in france language, so the word "Scierie" is sawmill in france, using google maps use dork "Scierie near laon and reims, got a few more sawmill, but we gonna focuse on three sawmill since the messages say it between laon and reims.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcea8f64-326d-44bd-a8cf-d2114a0ff575)


>  7) After a few minute take around those three sawmill, we found the exact location which is Scierie Huberlant, use the location name in the bot /location function, it will give us another information.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d43b63-03e5-45b5-817e-5a9d5e293f45)


>  8) The information that we got is basically related to the mobile network's cell tower location which is MCC (Mobile Country Code): 208, MNC (Mobile Network Code): 10, AC (Location Area Code): 12102, CID (Cell ID): 9448453.

> 9) To find the location based on the information that we got, we can use tool called opencellid.org, fill in the search function with the information that we got, and it will lead to the location where the cell tower located.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01c74e5-87b0-40c6-9a8d-421f62424483)


>  10) There are to many cell towers in the map, how do you know which one is the one that we have to find, simply click the to the symbol and you can see the information of the cell tower, then we will find the exact tower with the same information that we got located at the Rue de Picardie street in Paris, that sound like our password. use it to unlock flag file and yup we got it.

![badge Kanonniers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60bc8232-1261-4a37-a0b8-1f1e98bf403d)

### Mission 

```
Greetings, Special Agent.

We are on the hunt for operatives of a competing Order. We believe them to be the continuation of a rival Order “The Golden Creed”, who we eradicated mid 18th century. Somehow the family running the Order managed to reorganize and fund new endeavors. Flying under the radar for several years, they now have a foothold in many European countries.

Unfortunately for them, they’ve chosen to cross paths with some of our bigger clients in several of these countries. Most recently, the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD, started investigating them after being linked to a human trafficking ring. All beginning with the Syrian refugee crisis a few years back.

What made this Order fly under the radar for many years, is their total aversion for the digital world. Barely dipping their toes in web 1.0, The Golden Creed uses mostly analog means of communication. Making them infinitely harder to track.

Our friends at the AIVD however once observed a member of The Golden Creed insert a package into an opening of a monument. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be instructions for a hit being placed by a client of The Golden Creed.

This leads us to your objective. Last week, an operative of The Golden Creed was arrested by Dutch police. Carrying a picture with him of an old cannon. Given their tendency to hide information in historical objects, we believe this particular cannon is a location of interest. Possibly holding information, or being frequently used to pass information.

Our client has asked us to locate the cannon. Use the image below to find the location of the cannon.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept

### Material 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdbc47b9-4091-46a3-aa60-69bac230db12)

### Answer Instruction 

```
Use your findings to generate the answer. For this you will need the service: [w3w](https://what3words.com/)

Format:
areacode-city-what-three-words

Example:

```

### Solution 

> 1) Reverse search the material and the result will show the location where cannon located which is `Elburg stadswandeling` located in the city of `Elburg`.
> 2) Next, we need to find where exact location of the cannon in the big area, here i use th website that show the photogenic spot in the place.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075e69ef-a684-4111-8420-de16922579d6)

> 3) As you can see the kannon located at the bottom of the area, let take a little more close up look using google maps on that area.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848d4e09-42b9-4036-ac1a-fbe151459d51)

> 4) There are 2 cannon in that area, but with the angle of the image in the material, we know the one that we talking about is the one at the left.
> 5) Using the W3W website to get the three words, we get these 3 words : `punk.runways.messed`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f51560-304c-4c63-9bfd-5308745121e6)

> 6) To find the area code, just google for `Elburg` area code and you will get the area code : `0525`. Combine it as our answer and we solved it.

### Mission 

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have an urgent matter on our hands. For several months we’ve been investigating a group called “Androktasiai”. A radical organization who believes in cleansing the planet of what they call gluttony. Believing firmly that humans are a disease that needs to be exterminated, this radical group is well organized and is preparing to strike several targets.

After breaching one of their email accounts, we were able to extract a sent item. The metadata didn’t prove to be of much help, as it was sent to a disposable 10minutemail address.

The contents however are of great interesting. We believe it contains instructions sent from one of the groups’ leaders to a sleeper cell. This sleeper cell will now be activated and preparing to carry out an attack somewhere.

It is your task to figure out what the text means and provide any intelligence about the plans of this organization.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### Answer Instruction

```
The answer will be in the follow format: ((this-is-the-flag))
```

### Solution 

> The Material given is an encoded text so we need to decode it to get the actual messages or maybe even the answer. First, fire up your `Cyberchef`  and cooked the encoded text using `base64`, then we will get the result which is another encoded text, using `cipher idetifir`, detected that the second encode is `vigenere cipher`, we know that to decode `vigenere cipher` we need a key. To find the key , we have to read the mission briefing back. As you can see in the mission brieffing : "We have an urgent matter on our hands. For several months we’ve been investigating a group called “Androktasiai”.". Maybe the group name is the key, try using "Androktasiai" and we decode it, read the decode text and you find the answer wrap in exactly like the answer instruction. Answer : `((SoFi-Stadium-33.953417,-118.338863,18))`.

![badge-april-fools](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3403f2e-00db-49a9-9b80-ec13727765be)

### Mission 

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

For now, Kotova and Schneider are on the back burner, as they’re under active surveillance. The case is under control, meaning your unit has time to participate in our yearly April training exercise.

This year we’ve chosen to partner with the S.I.S.U. group. An elite group of analysts, roughly the size of one of our ASIC cells. They’re skilled and only use their skills for good. This year, they’ve agreed to partner with SERPENT on a training exercise.

We’ve prepared a training event for them, and they’ve done the same for us. Creating a series of intricate puzzles and exercises to get through. Now I’m not saying this is a match, but obviously there will be some inter-agency rivalry involved.

It’s your team’s task to complete the assignment as quickly as possible. Or not, but I know you couldn’t stand the other teams beating you.

Also, what the hell does “peepeekun” mean?!
```

![april-fools-start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674af8be-80a5-4d37-81f3-2cab2a412e1b)


> the-vault-pee-pee-kun.zip (Lock zip filed) : 19 jpg files

### Answer Instruction 

```
To open the vault file: Use the first word of each what3words location.

Example: ball.sky.book

The flag will be a secret you extract from an image, you will know it when you see it.
```

### Solution 

> Unzip the `april-fools-start.zip` as our first step for the challenges and we got a `jpg` image files. At first i was trying to find what is `peepeekun`, and a bit suprise (its a D emoji :D). This chall is a mixed category so we need to use every way to get the next clue. So here i was trying to get any `secret information` from our start file. After several trying, i managed to extract the `secret` from the file, by using `Steghide` and `peepeekun` as the paraphase.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ba948e-2eea-4571-a9fe-a7950e09efa7)

> We got a secret txt file : `url-file`. From the file we obtain a link to puzzle game website, here is where it consume so many time to complete the puzzle. After a few hours, i managed to complete the puzzle, as you can see in the completed puzzle, some of the pieces contains a `white text`, seem like another link. Combine it together, i get : `bit.ly[Slash]3LDysz7`. 

![puzzled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ae907e-4069-4658-b9b6-b096df29c4fa)

> Visit the link, it bring us to a dropbox file thats contain `3 location images`, Here we need to find the `what3words` for all of the location and take each of the `first word` to open our `the-vault-pee-pee-kun.zip` file. Inside of the 3 images, we could see the `Peepeekun` marked, and we need to find the 3words where the `peepeekun` was.

> It take at least a few minutes to find the location due to the `signature building` in the image, the tricky part is to find the 3 words for each `Peepeekun`location, after a few try, i found it. here is the breakdown : 

```
1) Statue of Liberty - ///case.shift.hush
2) Pyramid of Gazi -  ///thrillers.recline.annoys
3) louvre pyramid -  ///jams.banana.canines
```

> Using each of the location `first words` as the password to open the `the-vault-pee-pee-kun.zip` files, and we in. There is a total of 19 images fiies, in the vault zip file, Examine one by one of them. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42cebf7-3279-43e7-b1e2-06d778329aaa)

> After examined them, one of the files : `0004.jpg`, on the bottom left of the images, we'll see some kind of `text` threre : `D94KF932409KGL09324`, must be the password to open the flag file. Use it as the password to open the flag file, and yah we solved it.

### Answer Instruction 

>  insiderfirstName_classification_SixDigitCode


### Solution 

> Investigate both of the EWG staff profile, going through on every posts, captions, like, images, photos and every details of each account. After a few searching, on the second profile - Sofia jiminez, one of the post seem like she exposed her `login credentials` which is her `work email` and `password` for the company forecast modeling system database. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd4b69a-49c4-400a-bd83-4b54350a7599)

> Focus the investigation on Sofia Jiminez, trying to looking any other things such as `six digit code` or hint but nothin, but remember that Sofia Jiminez had leaked her  `work email` on the previous post right? maybe we can `contact` or `interact` with her `work email`. So here I composed an email and sent to her `work gmail` and see if there will be any response from it. Fortunately, we in the right path cause the `work email` response to use by giving out the `six digit code`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22553233-28ca-4eb8-b3f9-c945859533c0)


> So our insider threat was `Sofia Jiminez`, the classification of her threat was `Negligent`, she ignoring the company security that can bring risk to the company which is by leaking her credentials. combine together with the `six digit code` as the answer and we solved it.

![Badge Red Star Recon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd50e7f-a44c-4d5e-9174-7e2e1add6265)

### Mission 

```
Greetings, Special Agent.

This is a mission vital to national and international security. Recent intelligence has uncovered that North Korea has launched a
new type of reconnaissance satellite, capable of advanced surveillance and potentially equipped with offensive capabilities. Your
mission is to decipher the intercepted communications from this satellite to prevent a possible threat.

Intelligence reports indicate that the satellite is set to scan and potentially target three specific buildings across the globe. These
locations are believed to hold significant strategic value, and their security is paramount. Your first task will be to collaborate with
our cyber operations team to decipher North Koreas encrypted transmissions.

Furthermore, you will coordinate with SERPENT to ensure the protection of the buildings once identified. Each location will
require a tailored approach, considering both the physical and cyber defenses in place. Your expertise in strategic infiltration and
countermeasures will be crucial in thwarting any offensive actions taken by North Korea.

This mission demands a combination of stealth, precision, and rapid decision-making under pressure. Success will not only
neutralize a potential threat but also provide us with valuable intelligence on North Korean satellite capabilities.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

> Based on the transmission, it mentioned 3 location : `Region Buenos Aires, Brasilia, Miami` maybe that is the location for all the 3 images gave to us. And then we get the `transmission signature` as part of the flag which is : G0032

> So next we need to find in english all of the 3 locations in the materials, here the break down along with the location english.

```
1) Southeast Financial Center, Miami - no need to translate anything the location is southeast financial center
2) National Congress, Brasillia - National Congress
3) Casa Rosada, Buenos Aires = Translate casa rosada to english its mean Pink House.

## CYBER-OSINT: The alien Stalker - Hard 

![Badge The Alien Stalker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf68e1f-0946-499c-ac83-048e8a88aa8a)

### Mission 

```
We've got a peculiar case on our hands. It involves an alien, a stalker, and a misplaced phone.

A young woman named Kate reported a strange encounter on her patio. She claims to have witnessed a humanoid figure with unusual features, staring at her from the shadows. This wasn’t your typical creepy stalker, however. Apparently, the figure had a bit of an existential crisis when she noticed him staring. He panicked, tossing a smartphone onto the patio before disappearing into the night.

We've retrieved the phone, and our IT forensics team has discovered a curious program hidden within. They believe this program might hold the key to identifying the alien.

The problem? It’s heavily obfuscated and encrypted, so we need your expertise.

Your mission:

Reverse engineer the program found on the alien's phone. Inside, you'll find a crucial piece of information that identifies the alien. Remember, the clock is ticking! This alien might be watching from the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. This is a high-risk mission, Special Agent. But we have faith in your skills. The fate of Earth, and Kate, may rest in your hands.

The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

```
1) mov al, 50h and add al, 4:
mov al, 50h: Load 50h (ASCII 'P') into the al register.
add al, 4: Add 4 to al. This results in 54h, which corresponds to 'T' in ASCII.

2. mov r8b, 40h and add r8b, 0Fh:
mov r8b, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into r8b.
add r8b, 0Fh: Add 0Fh to r8b. This results in 4Fh, which corresponds to 'O' in ASCII.

3. mov r9b, 40h and add r9b, 0Dh:
mov r9b, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into r9b.
add r9b, 0Dh: Add 0Dh to r9b. This results in 4Dh, which corresponds to 'M' in ASCII.

4. mov cl, 40h and add cl, 1:
mov cl, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into cl.
add cl, 1: Add 1 to cl. This results in 41h, which corresponds to 'A' in ASCII.

5. mov r10b, 40h and add r10b, 0Ch:
mov r10b, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into r10b.
add r10b, 0Ch: Add 0Ch to r10b. This results in 4Ch, which corresponds to 'L' in ASCII.

6. mov dl, 40h and add dl, 9:
mov dl, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into dl.
add dl, 9: Add 9 to dl. This results in 49h, which corresponds to 'I' in ASCII.

7. mov sil, 40h and add sil, 5:
mov sil, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into sil.
add sil, 5: Add 5 to sil. This results in 45h, which corresponds to 'E' in ASCII.

8. mov dil, 40h and add dil, 0Eh:
mov dil, 40h: Load 40h (ASCII '@') into dil.
add dil, 0Eh: Add 0Eh to dil. This results in 4Eh, which corresponds to 'N' in ASCII.
