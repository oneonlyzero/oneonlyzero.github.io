I got to know this CTF on 24 hours before the CTF end, thanks to Trace Labs community for the information. Managed to secure 23rd on this CTF. OSMOSIS Institute is the governing body of OSMOSIS — An Association for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Professionals. This engaging OSINT exercise is the perfect opportunity to uncover and analyze publicly available information to capture the “flag.” Sharpen your skills, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and push your limits in a dynamic and engaging environment.

#### Solution 

> To find the press released date for the mobile phone in the material, first we need to identify what is the model of the phone, I was an Mobile Phone Repair Technician before, so it was quite easy to identify the phone model. Either `Iphone 4` or `Iphone 5`

> Find the press released date for both model and tried as a flag and you got it, the flag is : FLAG{26/06/2010} <-- Iphone 4

#### Solution 

> This challenge solution is so straight, just focus on the magnifier glass handler in the material, you will clearly see the name of the owner "Holmes", a great detective last name is "Holmes"? who was it? one and only "Sherlock Holmes"
