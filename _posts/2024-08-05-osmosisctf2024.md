I got to know this CTF on 24 hours before the CTF end, thanks to Trace Labs community for the information. Managed to secure 23rd on this CTF. OSMOSIS Institute is the governing body of OSMOSIS — An Association for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Professionals. This engaging OSINT exercise is the perfect opportunity to uncover and analyze publicly available information to capture the “flag.” Sharpen your skills, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and push your limits in a dynamic and engaging environment.
