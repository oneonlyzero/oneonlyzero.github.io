I got to know this CTF on 24 hours before the CTF end, thanks to Trace Labs community for the information. Managed to secure 23rd on this CTF. OSMOSIS Institute is the governing body of OSMOSIS â€” An Association for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Professionals. So here I am sharing on how I'm solved some of the challenges.

#### Solution 

> To find the press released date for the mobile phone in the material, first we need to identify what is the model of the phone, I was an Mobile Phone Repair Technician before, so it was quite easy to identify the phone model. Either `Iphone 4` or `Iphone 5`

#### Solution 

> This challenge solution is so straight, just focus on the magnifier glass handler in the material, you will clearly see the name of the owner "Holmes", a great detective last name is "Holmes"? who was it? one and only "Sherlock Holmes"
