I 've found the leaked data of the key management group of the Malaysia's Company. This private data was obtained from telegram message snapshot from channel known as @TheJacuzziOfficial, the user or channel was no longer exist. From the messages, shows the original and full caption made by DESORDEN Group which contains  the actual link of the sample stolen data uploaded on Anonfiles file sharing services and some personal information of the key management team including their CEO, Company Secetary and Coo. 

The personal information including the Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Date Of Birth, Identifaction Number, Position and Address of the victim. Avoiding false positive information, i tried to lookup the name (not touch others information due to privacy) and suprisingly the name lead to the correct person and correct position in the company.

## DESORDEN HACKTIVIST Telegram Channel?


<img width="750" height="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/147937a1-07ac-40c0-a39b-e69b94e474f4" />

From the cybercriminal arrestment [article](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/the-cybercriminal-with-four-faces-revealing-group-ib-s-investigation-into-altdos-desorden-ghostr-and-0mid16b/#act-2-reinventing-as-desorden) made by GROUP-IB. `DESORDEN` dark web post footer say that "WE DO NOT USE TELEGRAM" which indicated that `DESORDEN` have nothing associated to telegram either channel or user, which  might be their effort to prevent scammers from exploiting his reputation to deceive potential buyers.

But during my invesitgation, I found the snapshot of the message by no longer exist telegram user with the handler `@Darxe_Config`, which mentioned a few hacktivists telegram channel link. Which include `1 StealBit`, `Bjorkanism Group`, `Bjorka Spirit Group` and `DESORDEN HACKTIVIST` Telegram Channel. Luckily the link was not expired and I was able to view the message history in telegram channel.

This telegram look like a legitimate channel to me from a few perspective point: 

1. The channel was created on 2023 which before the date the cybercriminal was captured and during its prime time.

2. No sign of scammer try to xploiting their reputation to deceive potential buyers because the stolen data details start from the name, the size, sample data link and the contact method (TOR Chat, Matrix) is same as original.

3. The group admin mentioned a couples time, tell us, he was the admin for another private group. But the user no longer exist or changed to another username.

5. Accepted to join others ransomware and cybercriminals private channel. 

After january 2024, theres only forwarded messages from others ransomware and cybercriminal group which might be done by bot or maybe others "miss out" or left over cybercriminals associated with `DESORDEN`. Logically, since its a private channel, not everyone has the privilege to join unless you are trusted or known user to avoid from undercover or maybe enforcement spy.
