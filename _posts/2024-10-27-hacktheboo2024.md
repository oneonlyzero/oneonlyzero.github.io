Summarize : My mistake during this CTF was i played another CTF. From all 12 challenges (2 for each category), i managed to solve the 4 from Coding and Forensic category. This CTF mainly focus to beginner player, so I dont want to miss the chance, as a beginner-intermediate ctf player, i have to play this one too. Overall, great job to HTB for this awesome and friendly CTF. Learn a lot.
