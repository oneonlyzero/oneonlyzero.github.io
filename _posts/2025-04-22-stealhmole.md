> Out of all the tools I explored, my favorite by far was the Dark Web Tracker. It’s surprisingly powerful—just type in a keyword or phrase, and within seconds, it pulls in a ton of information from across the dark and deep web. No need to fire up Tor or sift through shady forums manually.What really impressed me was how comprehensive the results were. From a single search, I got documents, images, URLs, and related posts—all tied to the subject I was investigating. It’s a serious time-saver, especially if you’re worried about missing key details during manual digging.

> Before diving into the full details of a finding, you can quickly preview it by clicking on its title. The preview pops up right in the main canvas, giving you a snapshot of the content without needing to open it in a new tab or window. Super convenient when you're skimming through a lot of results.
Check out the image below to see how it works in action:

### Canvas 

Once you create a new investigation case, you’re given a blank canvas to work with. This space is where you can log all your findings, track details, and organize your thoughts throughout the investigation. It’s surprisingly intuitive and easy to use—kind of like having a digital notebook tailored for OSINT work.

> When you start searching, the keywords you use are automatically added to your canvas. Each keyword, subject, or target gets its own dedicated note, so your findings stay organized and separate. Nothing gets merged or mixed up, which makes it super easy to keep track of what belongs to which search.

> If you confirm that a finding is relevant, you can easily add it to your canvas by clicking the “+” icon next to the result. It’ll instantly be saved and linked to the specific subject, target, or keyword it’s associated with. No copy-pasting or manual organizing—everything stays connected and tidy, making your investigation process way more efficient.
